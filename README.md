### Collaboration Features ü§ù

The ATM application does not include collaboration features as it is designed for individual use. However, if integrated into a broader system, potential collaboration features could include:

| Collaboration Option | Description                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| *Shared Accounts*      | Multiple users can access a single account. |
| *Task Assignments*     | Assign tasks related to account management.  |
| *Communication Tools*  | In-app messaging for user support.       |

### Reporting üìä

Users can generate reports of their transactions by implementing a method to retrieve account activity. Below is an example of a generated report in JSON format:

```json
{
  "accountNumber": 123456,
  "transactions": [
    {
      "type": "Deposit",
      "amount": 200.00,
      "date": "2024-01-01",
      "description": "Initial deposit"
    },
    {
      "type": "Withdrawal",
      "amount": 50.00,
      "date": "2024-01-02",
      "description": "ATM withdrawal"
    },
    {
      "type": "Transfer",
      "amount": 100.00,
      "date": "2024-01-03",
      "description": "Transfer to account 654321"
    }
  ],
  "currentBalance": 50.00
}
```
## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

### Common Issues

**Incorrect PIN**  
Users may enter the wrong PIN when attempting to log into their accounts. Ensure that you are entering the correct PIN associated with your account.

**Insufficient Funds**  
This error occurs when trying to withdraw or transfer an amount that exceeds the available balance in the account. Always check your balance before performing transactions.

**Account Not Found**  
If a user tries to log in with or transfer to an account number that does not exist, they will encounter this issue. Verify that you have entered the correct account number and that the account has been created.

## Advanced Usage

### Scripting

While the ATM application does not support direct scripting, users can enhance functionality by modifying the Java source code to automate certain tasks. For example, you could create a method to handle batch deposits for multiple accounts. Here‚Äôs an example script:

```java
// Example of a method to automate multiple deposits
public void batchDeposit(HashMap<Integer, Account> accounts, int accountNumber, double[] amounts) {
    Account account = accounts.get(accountNumber);
    if (account != null) {
        for (double amount : amounts) {
            account.deposit(amount);
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println("Account not found.");
    }
}
```
